# pyripper2
Image &amp; video ripper made with Python 3.5.

The first PyRipper got permanently erased in a tragic accident, so here's the second version, PyRipper2. Only the Instagram
ripper has been rewritten, and even that is still in a primitive form. Usage is fairly simple. Run the program (IDLE is
recommended) and type in "instagram account_to_be_ripped" and the program will do its thing. If the account is private, you will
need to supply login credentials in the "logins.txt" file in order for the ripper to work. This system is obviously not ideal,
but it's what we've got for now.

# pyripper2
Image &amp; video ripper made with Python 3.5.

Required modules (installed with pip):
selenium

The first PyRipper got permanently erased in a tragic accident, so here's the second version, PyRipper2. Only the Instagram
ripper has been rewritten, and even that is still in a primitive form. Usage is fairly simple. Run the program (IDLE is
recommended) and type in "instagram account_to_be_ripped" and the program will do its thing. Logging in for ripping private
accounts is done manually by default, but auto-login can be enabled in config.txt.
